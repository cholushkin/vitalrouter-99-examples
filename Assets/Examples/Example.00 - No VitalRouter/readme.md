## üî∑ What VitalRouter Offers (in short)
VitalRouter is a central, programmable, async-capable router that allows you to define composable, middleware-like pipelines for routing data, input, or intent throughout your app. You gain:

- Flexible, layered processing chains
- Clean handling of N:N communication
- Centralized, testable, and composable message flow
- Built-in async support, perfect for Unity‚Äôs modern toolchain (UniTask, etc.)

## üî∑ What are the ‚Äústandard Unity ways‚Äù to handle the same needs?
Without VitalRouter, Unity developers typically handle these patterns using a variety of patchwork solutions:

- Input routing or UI flow:	UnityEvents, InputSystem callbacks, MonoBehaviours
- Event-driven architecture: C# events / delegates, ScriptableObject signals
- Async sequences / workflows: Coroutines, UniTask chains in service classes
- Message passing (N:N): EventBus, Signals (Zenject-style), singleton managers
- Command routing or dispatching: ServiceLocator, manually coded switch/case routers
- Decoupled logic + chaining : Custom interfaces and lots of boilerplate glue

Each of these works, but tends to break down when the system gets complex.
